# Problem Statement

Write a script that creates 25 empty (0 KB) files.
The file names should be <yourName><number>, <yourName><number+1>, <yourName><number+2>, and so on.
Design the script so that each time you run it, it creates the next batch of 25 files with increasing numbers starting with the last or maximum number that already exists.
